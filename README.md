# Bitplane_extracted_MOD
Bit plane extracted moving object detection using frame comparison, also consists of conventional methods like Frame differencing and optical flow

For bit plane slicing check the model bitplane_split_merge2_final.mlx

For implementation of bit plane extracted frame differencing for moving object detection FRAME_diff_example.mlx
